Code Book for the tidy data set produced by run_analysis.R
========

1. Subject ID
-------------

   Integer from 1:30 indicating the Id of the subject which this observation is for

2. Activity
-------------

   Factor variable with levels determined by the "activity_labels.txt" file in the data set.  Current values are:
   1. WALKING
   2. WALKING_UPSTAIRS
   3. WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
   4. SITTING
   5. STANDING
   6. LAYING

3. FeatureName
---------------

   Factor variable defining the feature this observation summarizes.  The feature names are defined in the UCI HAR Dataset's "features.txt" file and "features_info.txt" files.  Only features that end in mean() or std() are included.
Further details copied from "features_info.txt" is included at the end of this file.

4. Function
----------------
   
   Factor variable defining which aggergation function this observation is for.

   1. mean
   2. sd   (standard deviation)

5. Measurement
-----------------

   Floating point number, this is the measurement applying the aggregation function in the Function column to all the measurements of the variable in the FeatureName column for all data points from the SubjectID on the Activity (given in those respective columns).

=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
mad(): Median absolute deviation 
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr(): Interquartile range 
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean
